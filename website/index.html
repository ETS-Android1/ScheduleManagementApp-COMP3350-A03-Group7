<h2 style="text-align: center;">Vision</h2>
</b>
<div class="visionContent">
<p>The Schedule management application will be used to plan out the activities of the user on a by-day or by-week basis. The application will be accessible via Android device so that the user would be able to access it at any point given that they have access to their Android device. The application can display the user’s schedule (previous, current, and future) as well as allow the user to make changes to their schedule.
    The app will feature the ability to create a schedule, view or edit existing schedules, add the user’s availability, and send alerts or reminders to the user for upcoming events depending on their specification. The user will be able to share their schedule and availability with other users by creating group(s) of users and by granting access to other people (workplace schedule), or by sharing individually to others (mutual event, meeting, dates, etc.).
    The alerts or reminders would be scheduled by the user at the interval of their choosing (week before, day before, hour before, minutes before). It would also be possible to allow the users to view any of their created schedules as well as allow the user to track their progress by browsing the history of completed tasks based on a schedule(s). The app will also provide a user performance tracker by displaying the average number of tasks that have been accomplished each day/week.
    The schedules will show the events or activities the user will be participating in. It will also allow the user to be able to send a message whether they would be able to attend the event due to unforeseen circumstances. The schedules will be easily viewable and can display any conflicting schedules.
    The target audience would be everyone since people usually planning out how they would like to spend their time during the day or a period of time. An example would be for a workplace where the supervisor or manager would be scheduling the staff or employees that would be working during that day, the employees could also submit their availability to the work schedules such that the supervisor or manager would be able to view and work with it. Individuals can use the app to schedule or plan an event and be able to share it with other people or invite other people to the event,
    this should also allow individual users to inform whether they would or would not be able to attend any event. This app would allow the users to manage their time more efficiently and effectively by allowing the users to plan out their week/day and communicate it to others if needed. The app will also help avoid conflicts that may arise from 2 or more events happening at the same time.
    The app would be considered successful based on three criteria. First, how easy and intuitive it is to learn and use the application. Second, how easy it would be to implement or adapt the app into their daily lives. Finally, how effective and helpful is the app for managing or scheduling their time or tracking their progress. If the first two of the criteria are met, the app would be considered a successful app.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A postmortem of our development experience</h2>
</b>
<div class="textContainer">
<ol type="1">
    <li>What went right in the development process?</li>
    <p>
        We had an idea of what we want the project to be, how it would look like, how we want people to use it. pretty much the brainstorming portion and the foundation for the app/project. Our idea of the system seemed to be consistent with all of us. Fair to say that working on a project in the current situation is difficult with getting everyone on the same page visually. In the end, I think we are all comfortable with the scope of the application.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li>What went wrong in the development process?</li>
    <p>
        We did not fully think out how we would implement the database interactions, how we would build the database to interact with an android app and thus making us bite more than we can chew which led to having quite a bit of technical debt that we have to pay back. I think we initially wanted to do more with the project than we were ideally capable of accomplishing. As we progressed, we had to make changes to our expectations based on how much we could accomplish. Ultimately,
        we ended up focusing on the key requirements that make the app what it is at its core but ended up removing features that would have made our application stick out from the crowd.
    </p>

        What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?
    </li>

    <ul>
        <br>
        <li>What did you learn about team or large project development?</li>
        <p>
            Communication and documentation are essential in projects. We learned to be willing/open to pitch an idea and get feedback from the other members. Since feedback helped us to define the scope of projects and have a more unified vision as a team. Being a new experience having worked in teams we understand that things need to run smoothly and there will be conflicts in code sometimes we need to work as a group to figure things out. Overall, we have all learned from errors or mistakes we made while working as a team. Also when you get stuck do not forget to ask for help.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>What will you start doing</li>
        <p>
            Asking for more feedback and trying to ask for it more often. this would help with the planning in how to go about starting to do a task, develop or even code up an idea a team member may have.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>What we will keep doing</li>
        <p>
            Try and keep track of how everyone is doing on their end of the project - ask if anyone needs clarity. Make sure to properly communicate with team members so that everything is in sync/no unintended bugs/coding errors pop up before committing any massive commits. - inform the team of what I would plan on changing and get feedback on whether it's a good idea or not.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>What we will stop doing</li>
        <p>
            Coding like hell for sure! and avoid rushing the thought process when it comes to how we want to present our idea.
        </p>

    Unfortunately, we did not properly document our velocity throughout the iterations. Most of the data in the graph is determined through our discussion in class from when we were discussing velocity as a topic. In iteration 1, we did poorly. We took on more work than we could handle in this iteration and ended up underperformed. We ended up having to assign work for uncompleted features to the next iteration.
    We ended up with prudent inadvertent technical debt for the user database which was eventually resolved in the next iteration. In iteration 2, the amount of work we completed was closer to what we estimated. Closer to the deadline we realized that we needed to ignore failing tests in order to salvage other parts of the system in order for it to function. In iteration 3, after discussing velocity in class we realized that we had to plan out our time much better in order to maintain our goals for the iteration and end product.
    We laid out all work that needed to be completed within the time frame of the iteration and improved upon our time management in order to complete these tasks. Overall the graph shows the we had a poor start due to our bad estimation on the amount of work we could handle per iteration. The next one was almost the same but shows progress since we got closer to our goals. Finally we met our targets that we had set out to do for that iteration. This shows that over time the velocity of the team got better as we approached the end of iteration 3.

        <dd> I learn't how to properly test, especially to testing how interchangeable components would interact and how to write an intuitive System tests that demonstrates how the app/project functions using the espresso library.</dd>

        <b><dt style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;">Taylor Roy</dt></b>
        <dd>The most important thing I've learned is how everything apart from coding matters in creating the best product possible. Communication and documentation are key to getting everyone on the same page - keeping everything on schedule. It can be very easy to get lost otherwise. Being open to dropping/modifying features or making compromises to present the best product possible.</dd>

        <dd>I was able to pick up a few skills will working as a team. Some of the skills picked up was identifying types of different tests need depending on the different areas we have to test of the software. over time i learn't about the key importance of better time estimates and how time management is key during development.</dd>

        <b><dt style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;">Thai Tran</dt></b>
        <dd> I have been able to improve and gain a lot of experience working on the frontend and also backend alike. As we went through each iteration where we as a group faced problems and bug that we had to handle, fixing and solving these issues. This helped me to develop and improve my skills in developing both UI and adding improvement to the logic of the app.</dd>
