Branching Strategy
======
GitHub Flow

Reasoning
- It Requires us to ***Discuss*** any changes to a feature prior to committing them to the main branch
- Easier to use for Developing independent features as we can expand/add to an existing point of the branch without affecting the whole project accidentally
- It is easier to merge the development branches as it should not affect anything other than the newly added features or new changes to the features as they are worked on individually
